This is a stub. Do not shoot me!

# Intention

This sub project is mostly private and it is on GitHub primarily to get accustomed to GitHub itself.

# Glue code for development tasks

The repo `devsupport` contains mechanics and libraries used by my various projects.

It adds higher level support to abstract from boilerplate needed to comply to various standards as

* Rubyforge/Gem
* Debian packages
* GNU projects

There is supporting stuff for

* vim
* rake driven front ends for several build styles
  * Ruby projects with Hoe
  * Ruby projects without Hoe
  * Ruby on Rails
  * C++ with CMAKE
  * C with GNU Autoconf
* yard extensions
* TDD/BDD/CI cycles and wiring

Some of this integration **is really brittle** or stubby. So use is for insprirational purposes, but not directly. OK?

# Usage as submodule

The canonical usage is inclusion as *git submodule* by the very same name.

# To be continued...
